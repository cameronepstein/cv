# Cameron Epstein

Since working as a music sourcer and talent scout, I have decided to broaden my horizons and focus on building a new career in the technology industry.

After one of the most academically challenging years of my life I've graduated from [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) with an unshaken belief that the constantly evolving, creative environment in tech will allow me to best utilise the qualities I posses.

I enjoy working in teams, have great inter-personal skills and truly believe I will thrive as a junior developer.

Most importantly, I couldn't be more excited about the journey ahead!

## Skills

##### New Technologies :iphone:

I've enjoyed learning new languages every few weeks. Despite the constant imposter syndrome, I am now proficient in many technologies which previously seemed perplexing.

  I have taken on Node and Rails for web apps, database languages like SQL, and a variety of front-end languages over the past year (HTML5, CSS, Sass).

  Essentially this sustained problem solving has provided me with a constant thirst for new exciting tech!  With this in mind I aim to continue learning as much as possible in my next career, enhancing my academic and technical ability as well as working on new exciting projects.

##### Agile Development :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Firm follower of the agile development principles. Strong belief that they not only play a key role in developer happiness but also lead to success in business.

##### TDD :traffic_light:

Strong background in TDD, with experience in Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai and more.

##### Domain Modelling :rocket:

Avid enthusiast of the domain modelling process. Particularly when coordinating group ideas.

##### Inter-personal/Teamwork :city_sunrise:

Enjoy working with and organising teams, particularly fond of pair programming.

##### Simplicity :nut_and_bolt:

Actively design software with single responsibility principle in mind.

## Interests

##### Music

I am absolutely fanatical about music. In particular I enjoy [jazz/funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_5a6OkyBaY), [reggae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTK99CNnORQ), [rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXwMrBb2x1Q) and [a variety of classics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJV2pWFyfn4). I am addicted to record shopping and regularly curate playlists/mixes for personal or professional use.  

I am a passionate DJ/producer and regularly perform live. I have played at events like MADE, Hospitality, FACE, Annie Mac Presents and festivals like Outlook, Dimensions and Global Gathering. Additionally, I am currently working on a concept album and graphic novel under the name Last Man on Earth.

##### Film/Drama

After my university course I have become a huge fan of modern and classical film.
My favourite directors include Stanley Kubrick, Wes Anderson and Sebastian Silva.

##### Blog

I am currently working on a [ technology blog](https://computer-love.com/), based loosely on the 1981 Kraftwerk track [Computer Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWTUt2RZh0).
