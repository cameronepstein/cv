# Cameron Epstein

After working as a music sourcer and curator I am focused on building a new career in the technology industry. I truly feel that its constantly evolving, creative environment will give me an opportunity to best utilise the qualities that I posses.

I am a passionate, enthusiastic developer, recently graduated from the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) course, with good inter-personal skills and a firm belief that I would thrive as a junior developer.

## Skills

##### Agile Development

Firm follower of the agile development principles. Strong belief that it not only plays a key role in developer happiness but also leads to success in business.

##### TDD

Strong background in TDD with experience in Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai and more.

##### Domain Modelling

Avid enthusiast of the domain modelling process. Particularly when coordinating group ideas.

##### Inter-personal/Teamwork

Enjoy working with and organising teams, particularly fond of pair programming.

##### Simplicity

Actively design software with single responsibility principle in mind.

##### New Technologies

I've enjoyed learning new languages every few weeks. Despite the constant imposter syndrome, I am now proficient in many technologies which previously seemed perplexing.

  I have taken on Node and Rails for web apps, database languages like SQL, and a variety of front-end languages over the past year (HTML5, CSS, Sass). Essentially this sustained problem solving has provided me with a constant thirst for new exciting tech!  

  With this in mind I aim to continue learning as much as possible in my next career, furthering my academic and technical ability as well as working on new exciting projects over the coming years.

## Interests

##### Music

I am absolutely fanatical about music. In particular I enjoy [jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_5a6OkyBaY), [reggae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTK99CNnORQ), [rock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXwMrBb2x1Q) and [the classics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXwMrBb2x1Q). I am addicted to record shopping and regularly curate playlists/mixes for personal or professional use.  

I am a passionate DJ/producer and regularly perform live. I have played at events like MADE, Hospitality, FACE, Annie Mac Presents and festivals such as Outlook, Dimensions and Global Gathering. Additionally, I am currently working on a concept album and graphic novel under the name Last Man on Earth.

##### Film/Drama

After my university course I have become a huge fan of modern and classical film.
My favourite directors include Stanley Kubrick, Wes Anderson and Sebastian Silva.

##### Blog

I am currently working on a [ technology blog](https://computer-love.com/), based loosely on the 1981 Kraftwerk track [Computer Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtWTUt2RZh0).
