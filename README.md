# Cameron Epstein

After working as a music sourcer and curator I am focused on building a new career in the technology industry. I truly feel that its constantly evolving, creative environment will give me an opportunity to best utilise the qualities that I posses.

I am a passionate, enthusiastic developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy course, with good inter-personal skills and a firm belief that I would thrive as a junior developer.

## Skills

* Agile Development

Firm follower of the agile development principles. Strong belief that it not only plays a key role in developer happiness but also leads to success in business.

* TDD

Strong background in TDD with experience in Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai and more.

* Domain Modelling

Avid enthusiast of the domain modelling process. Particularly when coordinating group ideas.

* Inter-personal/Teamwork

Enjoy working with and organising teams, particularly fond of pair programming.

* Simplicity

Actively design software with single responsibility principle in mind.

* New Technologies

I've enjoyed learning new languages every few weeks. Despite the constant imposter syndrome, I am now proficient in many technologies which previously seemed perplexing.

I have taken on Node and Rails for web apps, database languages like SQL, and a variety of front-end languages over the past year (HTML5, CSS, Sass). Essentially this sustained problem solving has provided me with a constant thirst for new exciting tech!  

With this in mind I aim to continue learning as much as possible in my next career, furthering my academic and technical ability as well as working on new exciting projects over the coming years.
