# Cameron Epstein

After working as a music sourcer and curator I am focused on building a new career in the technology industry. I truly feel that its constantly evolving, creative environment will give me an opportunity to best utilise the qualities that I posses.

I am a passionate, enthusiastic developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy course, with good inter-personal skills and a firm belief that I would thrive as a junior developer.
