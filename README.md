# Cameron Epstein

I am focused on building a successful career in the tech industry as its constantly evolving, creative environment will give me an opportunity to best utilise the qualities that I posses. I am a passionate, enthusiastic developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy course, with good inter-personal skills and a firm belief that I would thrive as a junior developer.
