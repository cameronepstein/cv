# Cameron Epstein

After working as a music sourcer and curator I am focused on building a new career in the technology industry. I truly feel that its constantly evolving, creative environment will give me an opportunity to best utilise the qualities that I posses.

I am a passionate, enthusiastic developer, recently graduated from the Makers Academy course, with good inter-personal skills and a firm belief that I would thrive as a junior developer.

## Skills

Firm follower of the agile development principles. Strong belief that it not only plays a key role in developer happiness but also leads to success in business.

Strong background in TDD, with experience in Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai and more.

Avid enthusiast of the domain modelling process. Particularly when coordinating group ideas.

I've enjoyed learning new languages every few weeks. Despite the constant 'I know nothing' feeling ringing in my brain, I am now proficient in many technologies which I could not previously wrap my head around (Node, Rails and SQL).

With this in mind I plan to continue learning as much as possible, furthering my academic and technical ability for years to come!

Node, React, JS, HTML5, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PSQL
